This project is a WIP. It aims to deliver a graphic, drag-and-drop-based designer (kind of like a flow-diagram) for creating the YAML definition for the Flow of an Oracle Digital Assistant.

It's in the form of a [web-app that can be run in a browser](https://riyadshauk.com/digital-assistant/).

$ `yarn && yarn start # installs and runs the app locally`
